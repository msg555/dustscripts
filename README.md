### Projects
  
##### Orb

This was the original "demo" of a replacement controllable entity with the
dustcript API. The original map this was attached is [Bounce
Tutorial](http://atlas.dustforce.com/8062/bounce-tutorial).

##### Geyser

This was created for the "Volcano" Custom Map Jam. This includes a custom script
trigger that can be configured to simulate a geyser erupting, pushing entities
in the direction it erupts. The trigger can be added to other scripts by
including "msg/geyser/geyser.cpp" or can be compiled stand-alone by compiling
"msg/geyser/main.cpp"
